Transformers to Reasoning Models: How LLMs Evolved

The progress in NLP over the last few years has been extraordinary. Each breakthrough hasn’t just improved performance — it has reshaped how we build and interact with AI systems.

Here are some of the pivotal shifts that shaped today’s Large Language Models: 

2017 — Attention Is All You Need
The Transformer architecture changed everything by enabling parallel processing and efficient scaling. This became the foundation for all modern LLMs.

2018 — BERT
Introduced bidirectional context and made pretrain → fine-tune the new standard for NLP tasks.

2020 — GPT-3 & Scaling Laws
Showed that simply scaling model size unlocks surprising emergent capabilities, such as few-shot learning.

2020 — T5 & Text-to-Text
Unified NLP tasks under one generalized framework — making model usage simpler and more flexible.

2020–2022 — RAG, LoRA & Instruction Tuning
 • RAG combined retrieval with generation for better factual grounding
 • LoRA made fine-tuning large models cost-efficient
 • Instruction tuning made models understand and follow natural language instructions

2022–2024 — Chain of Thought & Self-Consistency
Prompting techniques enabled step-by-step reasoning and improved reliability on complex tasks.

2025 — DeepSeek-R1 & Structured Reasoning
A shift toward models that reason, not just autocomplete — paving the way for AI that can analyze, plan, and validate its own answers.


Why this matters:
We’re moving from language models → to reasoning models.
The next wave of AI won’t just respond — it will think.
